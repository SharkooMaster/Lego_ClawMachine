# PA1473 - Software Development: Agile Project (Template)
## Introduction
The aim of this project is to create a lego robot capable of sorting lego bricks based on color.
The project I provide is a good infrastructure to achieving any of the features required with maintainable and understandable code.
Although I have not managed to complete all features or test them nearly enough, the source code should still act as a good start.

## Getting started
Install visual studio.
Select (open folder) and choose the project folder.
In the plugins tab, install `LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 MicroPython` and connect to the robot with a usb or wirelessly.
In the explorer tab, at the bottom, a EV3DEV tab should appear, select it and connect to the robot.
Press F5 to run the code.

## Building and running
Launch the program in Visual studio code with the Lego ev3 mindstorm plugin installed.
Connect to the lego robot and run the project in visual studio.

## Features
The main reason for not achieving all stories to the best of my ability is lack of time caused by join the course late, and the need to book the robot for 3 hours whenever I want to develop although  half the time goes to addressing hardware issues.
- [x] US_1: Zone system
- [x] US_2: Generic controller
- [x] US_3: Improved color detection (KNN)
- [x] US_4: GUI on the robot with an input system.
- [x] US_5: Sorting loop
- [ ] US_6: Working with other robots
- [ ] US_7: Stacking blocks. (Hardware issue)
